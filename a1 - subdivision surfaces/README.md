# Assignment 1: Subdivision surfaces
For my implementation, I first populated new_tri and new_vtx by, for each triangle in old_tri, looping through the vertices on that triangle to form edges and calculate their midpoints in order to add them, and the resulting four new triangles, into the desired arrays as well as the edge_vtx_map. I then looped through old_tri again and once more looked at the edges on each to populate the edge_tri_map with edges and their corresponding midpoint vert index. To smooth those midpoint vertices (or, odd verts) I looped through all edges in the edge_vtx_map and checked edge_tri_map for the triangles that included that edge to find the lone vertex on each not participating in the chosen edge. This provided all necessary info to calculate the necessary smoothing info. Finally, I populated vtx_vtx_map in a very similar manner to edge_tri_map, storing (as I did with that) the indices of the neighbors in an array of integers corresponding to their respective keys. For every index in vtx_vtx_map, I then calculated the size of the value array to get the number of neighbors (nbs) for that vert. This information was all that was needed to calculate beta. Looping through the neighbors to add their positions multiplied with beta to the original position multiplied by (1-(beta*nbs)). The result was first stored in a copy of new_vtx, then, after all original vertices were smoothed, the smoothed_vtces map was copied to new_vtx.

My inspiration for this project drew on the theme of fruit! I modeled a low-poly orange, with stem, blossoms, and an extra slice, in Maya and exported the .obj for use in this project. I chose the orange as my subject because itâ€™s the title of my favorite poem: The Orange by Wendy Cope.
