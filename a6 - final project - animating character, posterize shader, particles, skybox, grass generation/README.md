# Final Project: Wandering through Worlds

Macy Toppan: Character model, rig, and animation, animation rendering, environment models, textures, posterize shader.

Jasper Tucker: Particle behavior and rendering, swapping between particle systems, object movement

Julian Wu: Grass generation system and procedural animation

Amon Ferri: Skybox implementation and shader, skybox swapping, grass textures and grass texture swapping.

All: Constant debugging ðŸª²


## Result and concept

*Wandering Through Worlds* is our answer to the ideas of exploration and travel embodied in the â€˜Journeyâ€™ prompt. It takes a very literal approach, following the subjectâ€” a traveler traversing different climatesâ€” in an endless loop. Our inspiration came from Unreal Engineâ€™s â€˜Alternate Realitiesâ€™ Challenge, where graphics engineers were tasked to create a unique world tied around a given simple walk cycle. As a result, the scenes we chose to show depicted drastically different environmentsâ€” snowy mountain passes, lush meadows, and windy desertsâ€” as indication of the great distance covered. To illustrate the scenes and the character in them, I developed my own system of reading OBJ files overtime to animate between poses. I also built a posterized shader to further separate this world of adventure from ours. My teammates built particle systems, a cubemap-skybox system, and procedurally animating grasses to provide environmental movement and contexualize each stage of the voyage.
