# Assignment 4: Perlin Noise

For this assignment, I implemented all essentials functions for perlin noise, including hash2() (to produce a random value), perlin_noise(v) (to generate the noise), and noiseOctave() (to compute the noise at a set octave). I then applied these to mesh in both form and texture, and modified the results to simulate a mountain scene.
