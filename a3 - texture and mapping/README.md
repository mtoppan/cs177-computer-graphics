# Assignment 3: Texturing and Normal Mapping

For this assignment, I deviated slightly from the instructions and wrote my UV calculations in respective fragment shaders rather than in main. For every sphere-based step, I conducted this in the same manner: I took the inverse tangent of x and z and divided it by 2*pi to find u, then took the inverse tangent of the radius and y, and divided by pi for v. In Step 0, I then took the floor of u and of v for every vertex and summed them. If the result was odd, the fragment color was set to black; otherwise, it was set to white. This method saved me from encountering the feared zig-zag seam that others seemed to frequently face. In Step 1-4, I used normal_mapping.vert and normal_mapping.frag— for the first three of these, I used the same calculation of u and v, while for Step 4, I used the UVs imported with the non-spherical object. I used the recommended texture function first, then incorporated the principles of lambertian shading that we implemented on the last assignment for Step 2. For Step 3, I brought in tangents and normals from the vertex portion of the shader to the fragment and calculated the tangent, bitangent, and normal matrix to implement a normal map.

For the final creative portion, I thought back on my one experience in a true classic flea market— the Elephant Trunk Flea Market in New Milford, Connecticut. I remember being both enamored with this adorable, rusty shell of an old car and confused by the large number of tires at the market. As both a decrepit car and a worn tire feed into normal mapping well, creating varying textures, I called on both visual memories here. All models were scavenged from Sketchfab, with UVs corrected in Maya.
