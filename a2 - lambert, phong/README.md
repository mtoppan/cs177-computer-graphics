# Assignment 2: Lambert and Phong shaders
For this assignment, I drew inspiration from my favorite season— Winter! However, while in my opinion it’s the most beautiful time of year, the endless blanket of snow makes for a relatively grayscale scene. I didn’t want to lose that still, frozen-in-time feeling of the season so I opted for cool colors against an icy-purple/blue backdrop instead, with a warmer interior. The models were all built by myself in Maya for this assignment and were made to resemble a cozy cabin, buried in snow, with clouds of smoke implying a warmer space within.

To implement my_lambertian and my_phong, I referenced the slides significantly and attended Anna and Michelle’s TA hours, which was especially helpful to scripting specularity for the phong fragment. For both, I created light color and light intensity vec3 components, as well as constant floats for each constant. On the vertex side for both phong and lambert, I calculated normal, position, and color and sent them to the respective fragment shader. There, I used the input values as well as light color, position, and intensity and the constants to follow the equations presented in the slides and relay the material impressions.

After completing Steps 0-3, I modified main in Step 4 to allow for each object in the scene to take a different color. Specifically, I altered Update_Vertex_Color_And_Normal_For_Mesh_Object to take a Vector4f for color. This allowed me to choose material colors mesh-by-mesh and to send them in as inputs, rather than hard-coding them into the function. I also modified main to allow for both lamberts and phongs in the scene— more specifically, I constructed an array of integers, each corresponding to an object, with the same indices as the meshes themselves so that while looping through each mesh to render it, the script could know what type of material to add based on the number stored with that object’s index.

I also modified my_lambertian.frag and my_phong.frag after initially making them to allow for multiple lights in the scene so that I might back-light my scene. By creating three vec3 components— two in the case of lambert, given the lack of specularity— for each piece (ambient, diffuse, and specular) and storing light components in arrays (so an array for intensity, another for color, and another for position) I was able to loop through and sum the influence of all lights on the color of each vertex. The resulting render used five lights to allow for a thoroughly illuminated little world, inside and out.
